# SECURITY SYSTEM

### A simple SECURITY system on the basis of login and sign up mechanism(Code).

- It is simple console application without graphics developed in C++ programming.
- It is created in VS Code IDE and compiled with the javac compiler.

## Purpose:
- In this project you can registred your account by entering any username and password .
- Later on you can log-in in your account and also you can set the new password by first entering old password correctly .
- Data or Information you entered during login and registration process is saved in .txt file .

- So this code can be used in software/application in the case of Log-in and sign-up mechanism .



## Developement
### Header files I used are as follows -
- < sstream > 
- < fstream >
- < iostream >
- < string >

 ### Here I used the pre-defined classes in C++ , like   
  
  - istringstream
  - ifstream
  - ofstream
  
### Pre-defined functions I used -
- eof();
- getline();
- open();
- is_open();
- close();
